## PROBLEM STATEMENT
</br>
As we all know, open banking refers to open APIs that facilitate third-party developers to develop applications and services around the financial institution. This new-built technology is expanding at an exponential rate in the financial market. Nowadays, customers are switching to online banking since offline processes tend to become hectic and time-consuming. But one of the notable issues that bother people and financial firms is the security of data while retaining customer transparency. This issue affects the advancement of digitizing financial services.
Further, some of the prevalent open banking software we know are limited to money transactions and bill payments. So, clients use separate applications for different targets, which makes their online banking experience troublesome. Also, the customers barely find any applicable rewards or offers provided by their respective banks or service providers. So, open banking systems should constantly monitor customer insights, which can be rewarding for both client and service providers.
Overall, this problem statement asks us to find a way to ensure: Faster innovation in the field of open banking, personalized offers for clients and detailed monitoring of customer insights.
